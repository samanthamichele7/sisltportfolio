        <h3>Prior Experiences</h3>
        <p>I have always had an interest in technology, but when I was in high school and considering what I wanted to study in college, the idea of majoring in computer science or engineering intimidated me. Perhaps it was my (mistaken) view that programming involved little but advanced mathematics and algorithms; perhaps the fact that, of the two programming classes my high school offered, there was not a single female among the ranks made it seem inaccessible. Whatever it was, I decided to follow my love of reading into a degree in English Literature with the eventual goal of teaching the subject at the college level.</p>

        <p>When I was in my final semester of college, I took a C++ programming class as an elective -- partly because it interested me, but mostly because I was working full-time and it was one of the few classes that was offered in the evening and fit into my schedule.  On the first day of class, the professor pulled me aside and told me that, if I needed any extra help, he was available to me.  I fell in love with programming, though, and by the end of the semester the professor was asking me to tutor other students.  At that point, I knew that I wanted to go into technology as a career, although I had no idea what, specifically, I wanted to do.</p>

        <p>My partner was accepted into a Ph.D. program in MU's Educational, School, and Counseling Psychology department, and I followed him to Columbia.  It was not long until I started working at MU's Graduate School as an admissions adviser, and I re-discovered my interest in higher education.  As I began looking into options at MU for making the transition into a programming career, it seemed that I had two good options: go for a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science or apply for the master's degree program in Information Science & Learning Technology.  The latter option seemed like an excellent way to combine all of my interests and give myself a high degree of flexibility in choosing a career path, so I applied for the Summer 2011 semester.</p>

        <h3>During the program</h3>

        <p>When I look at the skills I possessed when I started my degree -- a familiarity with HTML and CSS, as well as a tenuous grasp on some of the most basic fundamentals of programming, but little else -- compared to where I am now, making a living as a freelance web developer, I can definitely see the value that my program of study already has brought to be professionally.  I've expanded my toolbox exponentially, and this program has given me a strong foundation to build upon as my interests and skills change and grow.</p>

        <p>If I had pursued a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science, as I was considering before I applied to SISLT, I might be a better programmer but undoubtedly would not have nearly so varied a skillset as I now possess.  I'm able to easily identify performance problems and evaluate outcomes; I understand advanced principles of interface design and usability; and I can develop a complete application, on my own or on a team, using modern coding standards.  I knew going into this program that, at the end of the two years it would take me to complete my degree, I wanted to be able to call myself a programmer.  I was able to learn and practice the skills to plan and develop any application I wanted, and even after I started to teach myself programming languages and skills that went beyond the scope of the program, my courses consistently gave me the chance to practice what I was learning and receive feedback from my instructors and my peers.  It was a supportive, safe environment to learn the skills I needed in order to find clients and do web development work professionally.</p>
  
        <p>As a web developer, and especially as a freelancer, having a large variety of skills at my disposal is invaluable.  Throughout the program, I've gained experience developing applications from scratch and overhauling previous people's projects, and this has translated directly into my work as a web developer: some of my clients have wanted a website built for a new business venture, and some have wanted their old sites redesigned.  In every single project I have completed as a freelancer, I have utilized all three LSDD competencies: I perform at least a basic needs assessment and evaluations; I design a new website through an exhaustive process that includes a problem analysis, design plan, and low-fidelity prototype; and I develop the website, either coding it by hand or using a content management system like Wordpress.</p>

        <p>One of my concerns going into this program was that, as someone who isn't a teacher, my career goals wouldn't align very well with some of the courses' objectives.  However, I was able to tailor my program of study to take classes that either focused on, or could be adapted to, the private sector.  Throughout the entire program, and especially after I started working as a freelance web developer, my professors were willing to give me the flexibility to pursue projects that interested me and aligned with my career goals.  This also gave me excellent opportunities to practice my programming skills, even if the language or framework was not officially taught in the SISLT program (PHP, JQuery, etc.)</p>

        <p>Even if every website is not technically a learning system, even the most basic brochure site strives to teach the user something -- perhaps why they should attend an event, hire a business, or visit a restaurant.  I'm able to use what I've studied about learning strategies such as cognitive overload, persuasive design/captology, performance support, and systems design to improve the information architecture and interface of everything I create.  The web is the single greatest hub of information in existence, and understanding how a user learns and disseminates content is key to a powerful web experience.</p>

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>

        <p>Even now, as I am about a month away from finishing my degree, I'm uncertain of my long-term career plans.  Short-term, my single biggest goal is to become a better programmer; even though I have a strong grasp now of how to build an application, including server-side elements like database integration, I am far from an expert.  My partner and I are planning to move back to Chicago, and I want to break into the city's vibrant startup scene and find employment for the next several years as a Ruby on Rails developer.  I look forward to using the skills I have learned and practiced over the last two years to bring value to a team.</p>
