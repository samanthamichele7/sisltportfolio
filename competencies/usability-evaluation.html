        <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
        <p>To learn more about the development of the PHI2WEB project, please see its <a href="design-phi2web.html">artifact page</a> for further information.</p>

        <p>PHI2WEB is a redesign of a prototype previously built by members of the MU Informatics Institute. It is a web portal interface designed to access information that was automatically extracted from biomedical literature (specifically host-pathogen interactions). The site incorporates social networking and Web 2.0 features to increase user engagement and encourage the management of information. The high-fidelity prototype my team built had three main goals: to improve the visual aesthetic design of the previous PHI2WEB prototype, resolve any usability issues, and apply captology theory (persuasive design) to encourage user participation in functions designed for socially-driven information management.  MUII is currently attempting to secure funding in order to develop the prototype we designed into a full-featured web application.</p>

        <p>Of all the projects that I completed evaluations for, the evaluation process for PHI2WEB was the most complex.  Because PHI2WEB was a previously-existing project, not something that was designed from the ground up, and because our work on the interface will be incorporated into the final development of the application by MUII, my partner and I had to take a very thorough approach to evaluation.</p><br />

        <h4>Evaluation Procedure</h4>
        <p>We incorporated a multi-stage formative evaluation throughout the lifecycle of the project.  While I would have liked in theory to perform a summative evaluation, it was not possible due to the fact that we were only designing a prototype meant to improve upon the interface, not developing a working application with a long-term impact. However, the project will require a summative evaluation once it is funded and completed, and our evaluation report may be a useful source of data to that team.</p>
        <p>In order to complete our Problem Analysis, we performed a formative evaluation through a user analysis in order to assess how well the old PHI2WEB prototype was meeting user needs as well as whether the instructional goals of the new system would be effective.  We gave a questionnaire to five target users who either had received or were working on a Ph.D. in a science-related field in order to gather information about how they would interact with and how they felt about a system like PHI2WEB, especially the social-networking/community/ranking elements. This helped us design many of the features in our final prototype.</p>
        <p>The second stage of our formative evaluation involved asking three of the five users to complete usability testing, consisting of a direct observation and a subsequent interview, on the old PHI2WEB application. We asked them to comment on usability issues, aesthetics, and how likely they were as students or researchers to use the system.  These three users repeated the process once our final PHI2WEB prototype was completed so that we could compare scores and assess the effectiveness of our improvements to the application.</p>
        <p>Several of our classmates also participated in our evaluation process. For both the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes my team designed, our peers answered questions about the application on a Likert scale.  Even though our classmates were not in our target demographic for PHI2WEB, their knowledge of learning systems and interface design strategies provided valuable feedback that we used to improve the final high-fidelity prototype.</p><br />

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>By tracking the opinions of one group of users throughout the entire evaluation process, we were able to get a concrete idea of the effectiveness of the changes we implemented. On a 1-50 scale, our usability testing scores increased from 36.3 with the old prototype to 47.6 with our version. Their opinions about the aesthetics, usability of the interface, and likelihood of utilizing the social features of PHI2WEB all increased substantially.  We also had high composite scores from our classmates' evaluations on both our low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes; on a Likert scale from 1-4, with 1 being "Strongly Disagree" and 4 being "Strongly Agree," we received a score of 3.5 for our low-fidelity prototype and a 3.4 for our high-fidelity prototype.</p>
        <p>Throughout our evaluation, we we followed the four basic activities described in our textbook by Rogers, Sharp & Preece (2011, pp.330): establishing requirements; designing alternatives; prototyping; and evaluating. By finding out how potential users would interact with the application and gathering data on the old PHI2WEB prototype, we were able to target key requirements early on in the process. We also gathered data throughout the design and development process in order to consistently assess whether we were meeting our goals. While we received suggestions for improvement at every stage, we were able to track a marked improvement in user opinions over the course of the project.</p><br />

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>Because PHI2WEB was an existing prototype, and because MUII had plans to secure funding and build it, the evaluation requirements for this project were much more stringent than other projects I worked on.  To develop an effective, improved interface, I had to perform extensive usability testing using a variety of methods (questionnaire, direct observation, interviews), then determine which feedback could be incorporated into the scope of the project over the course of a semester and which should be left as a recommendation to whatever team completes the application later on.  However, the drastic improvement in scores over the course of the project demonstrates the effectiveness of the evaluations my partner and I performed; the data we gathered, especially the direct observations / interviews with the same three users, leaves little doubt that the substantial changes we made to the interface design were positive.</p>
        <br />
        
        <h4>Role in evaluations</h4>
        <p>PHI2WEB was group project. Both my partner and I performed usability testing, but he focused on captological features and I focused on accessiblity and the social networking experience. However, I performed direct observations and interviews on users who interacted with both the old and new PHI2WEB prototypes.</p><br />
        
        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>One of the more challenging aspects of our evaluation was determining which feedback to implement in the prototype and which was beyond the scope of what two people could develop over a few weeks. Between Dr. Moore, our classmates, and our target users, nine different people provided feedback on our PHI2WEB prototype. We received many useful suggestions for everything from advanced social networking features to search results algorithms, but because the PHI2WEB application is such a massive project, it was impossible to implement all these features into our prototype.</p>

        <p>I took the Interface Design class before I took the class on Formative and Summative Evaluations, which is unfortunate, because I gained insight into effective evaluations that I could have utilized on this project. Incorporating subject matter expert reviews especially would have improved the evaluation process; since neither my partner nor I knew much about biomedical sciences, we were relying on general interface design principles and evaluation best practices rather than subject-specific ideas to create the interface design.</p><br />
