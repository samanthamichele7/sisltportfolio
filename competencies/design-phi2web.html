            <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
            <p>To learn more about the process of evaluating the PHI2WEB project, please see its <a href="usability-evaluation">artifact page</a> for further information.</p>

            <p>PHI2WEB is a redesign of a prototype previously built by members of the MU Informatics Institute. It is a web portal interface designed to access information that was automatically extracted from biomedical literature (specifically host-pathogen interactions). The site incorporates social networking and Web 2.0 features to increase user engagement and encourage the management of information. The high-fidelity prototype my team built had three main goals: to improve the visual aesthetic design of the previous PHI2WEB prototype, resolve any usability issues, and apply captology theory (persuasive design) to encourage user participation in functions designed for socially-driven information management. MUII is currently attempting to secure funding in order to develop the prototype we designed into a full-featured web application.</p><br />


            <h4>Artifact's Intended Purpose</h4>
            <p>PHI2WEB is designed to be used by the biomedical research community to evaluate, share, and manage abstracts of research articles involving host-pathogen interactions. PHI2WEB is designed to increase the usefulness and accuracy of the HPI information by employing principles of social informatics: the study of the design and uses of technologies in the cultural context (Kling, 2000; Kling, Rosenbaum & Sawyer, 2005) and crowdsourcing: the moving of labor from the traditional format of a few individuals to an open-call collaborative effort by a very large section of the user-base. PHI2WEB is intended to allow users to evaluate the accurace of host-pathogen interaction data through use of a voting mechanism and also provide the ability to suggest corrections to the data. Active users can increase their "ranking" on the site through frequent contributions, and all users have the ability to print off a service transcript in order to verify their record.</p><br />

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>Like the <a href="design-sislt-app-worksheet.html">SISLT Application Worksheet</a>, this project was a high-fidelity prototype that lacked the ability to save anything to a database.  As such, the focus was entirely on design.  However, it was unique in that instead of having to consider how to build a brand-new interface, I had to make improvements to an existing project.  The old PHI2WEB prototype had only basic functionality -- login and abstract search -- and my team was tasked with adding additional interactions such as social networking profiles, abstract reviews, and service transcript generation.  We performed extensive usability testing, far beyond the requirements of the assignment, to ensure optimal ease of use and accessiblity for target users (students, faculty, and research in the hard sciences.) As I detail on <a href="usability-evaluation">the evaluation artifact page</a>, our data suggests that our design strategies were highly effective.<br />
        
        <h4>Role in project</h4>
        <p>PHI2WEB was group project. I created the interface wireframes, while my partner did all the graphic design work and wrote most of the base HTML/CSS. I then finished work on the HTML/CSS and added all of the functional coding with JQuery and PHP.  Both my partner and I performed usability testing, but he focused on captological features and I focused on accessiblity and the social networking experience.</p><br />

        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>This project was suggested to us by Dr. Moore, the instructor of this course, who had worked on the previous PHI2WEB prototype with the MU Informatics Institute. My partner had also done some research on the subject of captology in Web 2.0 in an internship with Dr. Moore the summer before. Other than that, neither my partner nor I had much experience with biomedical research, which presented a challenge while we were designing this prototype -- especially considering the ambitious scope of the overall project. A complete prototype, especially one with advanced back-end functionality, was far more than the two of us could hope to accomplish in a semester. However, refining the design of the previous prototype while adding features like social networking profiles, abstract comments, and service transcript generation, provided a unique expereince.  Throughout the rest of my degree program, my projects have almost uniformly involved designing or developing something from the ground-up; getting the experience of refining a prototype that already existed allowed me to look at this competency from a different angle as I searched for ways to make improvements to PHI2WEB.</p><br />
