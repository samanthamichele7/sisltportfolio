          <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
          <p>This needs assessment was completed on behalf of the University of Missouri Graduate School. The summer before, administration at the Graduate School had decided to follow the lead of other departments at MU and move from a paper-based admissions system to a paperless system with electronic archival of files. The admissions team was faced with completely re-designing processes that had been developed over a decade of admitting both domestic and international graduate students, and not all members of the team were comfortable with the idea of integrating new technology in their daily workflow. This change caused a great deal of dissent among the admissions unit. Because of the extremely high volume of applications the Graduate School receives during the peak of the admissions season, it was of critical importance that all members of the team learn to use the system quickly and correctly. The fact that all paper files would be shredded upon being scanned into the electronic archival system only made the margin for error even smaller.</p><br />

          <h4>Artifact's Intended Purpose</h4>
          <p>The needs assessment was performed in order to identify and alleviate problems that occured during the initial planning stages of the project in order to ensure a smooth transition once the new system was implemented full-time. The report was intended to identify problem performers through analysis of both primary and secondary data sources in order to make recommendations for training materials that needed to be developed so the entire admissions unit would possess the requisite skills for the transition.</p>

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>I worked as an admissions adviser when I performed the needs assessment, and as the member of the team who was most comfortable with new technology, I was tasked by Graduate School administration to be sure all advisers were ready for the transition. My gathering and analysis of data enabled me to make solid recommendations for training materials and then develop them accordingly, and as a result, the process of moving from a paper-based to paperless admissions system overall went smoothly.</p><br />
        
        <h4>Role in project</h4>
        <p>The Needs Assessment report was an individual project.  I was responsible for gathering all data and writing as well as implementing the recommendations in the report.</p><br />

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Proposal submitted</li>
          <li>Review of performance/personnel records</li>
          <li>In-person interviews with advisers</li>
          <li>Telephone interviews with key members of other offices</li>
          <li>Personal observations of advisors</li>
          <li>Questionnaire/survey after paperless process has been implemented</li>
          <li>Data analysis</li>
          <li>Report Writing</li>
          <li>Report Delivery</li>
        </ol><br />
        
        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>Prior to taking this course, I had never performed a needs assessment before, but the timing of my acquiring this skill couldn't have been better. I had been put in charge of developing the new admissions process and training the entire team to follow it, and the technological literacy of the admissions unit varied wildly. This needs assessment enabled me to find a solution to the problem in a structured, thoughful way instead of experimenting until I managed to find something semi-effective.</p>
        <p>I actually find myself using the skills I learned in this course often as a freelance web developer. Whether a client has an existing website and is looking to make improvements or needs a site built from the ground up, performing a needs assessment allows me to find and correct problems that my client might not even be aware of.</p><br />
