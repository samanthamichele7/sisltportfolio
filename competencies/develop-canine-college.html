            <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
            <p>Canine College is an interactive application developed with Adobe Illustrator, Flash Professional CS5, and Actionscript3. It incorporates elements such as music, sound effects, text fields, a color picker, and timers to teach users the fundamentals of reward-based dog training. The app gives text and video-based instructions on the process for teaching a dog how to sit, lay down, and speak; after that, the module allows the user to "adopt" a dog (along with customizing the dog by giving it a name and changing its collar color) and practice these training fundamentals.The adoptable dog was created as vector art in Illustrator before being imported into Flash for animation. </p><br />

            <h4>Artifact's Intended Purpose</h4>
            <p>The application is designed to instruct users in teaching a dog to sit, lay down, and speak, and these fundamentals can be applied to teaching a dog almost any skill. After giving the user step-by-step instructions for each of the three skills, the application provides a video (which I recorded myself) in which I demonstrate the training process with my cocker spaniel, Sylphi. After the user "adopts" a dog, they can practice the skills further; however, the main purpose of that section is to demonstrate to the user, through the use of a timer, how quickly they must reward the dog for performing a trick.  As I explain in the video, if you don't reward the dog within a second or two for successfully performing a trick, the dog might believe that they're being rewarded for a different behavior -- the Flash application is meant to demonstrate how little time the user actually has to reward a dog.</p>

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>In order to successfully create this application with Flash Professional, I had to hand-code quite a few different features using the Actionscript 3 programming language. Aside from all the coding involved in interface creation, including elements such as volume control, I had to write functions for form validation, a colorpicker, a timer, drag-and-drop boxes, motion tweening, and sound effects.  This was one of my first major programming projects, and it was a good way for me to learn skills such as code management and object-oriented programming.</p><br />
        
        <h4>Role in project</h4>
        <p>Canine College was an individual project.  I was responsible for all content creation, graphic design, animation, and programming.</p><br />

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Project proposal</li>
          <li>Content creation</li>
          <li>Graphic design work completed</li>
          <li>Vector animation in Flash</li>
          <li>Usability testing</li>
          <li>Project submitted</li>
        </ol><br />
        
        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>Aside from some basic work in Javascript and IDE-assisted VB.NET programming, this project was my first experience with extensive, object-oriented programming by hand.  It solidified many programming concepts that I had previously struggled with, including strings, arrays, functions, etc., and even though I haven't used Flash at all since the course ended, I was able to transfer many of the concepts and skills I learned to other programming languages I now work with, like PHP and Ruby.</p>
        <p>If I were to go back and build this application again, or improve it, I probably wouldn't use Flash; a big part of my work as a developer is ensuring a high standard of accessibility, and unfortunately Flash does not work on most current mobile devices. That being said, I found Actionscript easy to work with language, and enhancing my graphic design skills through the use of vectors and animation was an excellent challenge.</p><br />
