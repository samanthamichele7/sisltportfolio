            <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
            <p>On Track: Roller Derby Skills Monitor is a mobile-optimized web application. It is designed for beginner roller derby players who are preparing to take the Women's Flat Track Roller Derby Association (WFTDA) skills test in order to compete in the official league. It is a dynamic, full-featured application that allows user registration and offers complete functionality. The application has three main areas that align with the sections of the WFTDA skills test: a 45-question, multiple choice test about the rules of roller derby; a list of required skills that allows users to check off ones they have mastered; and a log of users' attempts at skating 25 laps in 5 minutes, which is the minimum required to compete in the league.</p><br />

            <h4>Artifact's Intended Purpose</h4>
            <p>As a roller derby player myself, I was well aware of the difficulty beginner players (known as "fresh meat" on most teams) face in preparing to pass the minimum skills test in order to play in the league. Roller derby is a dangerous, full-contact sport, and the skills test is a hours-long endeavor that most women spend months preparing for. This application was developed in order to not only assist aspiring players in knowing what skills to practice but also allow them to track their progress over the course of months or even years of effort.</p>

            <p>Since most users would interact with OnTrack during beginners' practice or open skate sessions, the application is fully responsive and designed to be primarily accessed on mobile devices.  It does, however, require an internet connection, since it is a mobile web application instead of a native one.</p><br />

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>Of all of the development work I did throughout my program, OnTrack was the most involved and without a doubt was the most challenging.  Dr. Tsai wanted our team to build a fully functional web application, not a high-fidelity prototype as I did for most other classes, and I spent most of the semester honing my PHP and SQL skills so that I could develop the back-end functionality of the application while the rest of my team focused on front-end elements such as graphic design and data entry.  As a result, of all the learning systems I developed in my program, OnTrack was by far the most complete; I also coded all of the PHP by hand instead of relying on an Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio or Dreamweaver to do the heavy lifting like my teams did for other applications. Of all the work I completed in the program, I believe that this application is the best display of my programming and development skills.</p><br />

        
        <h4>Role in project</h4>
        <p>OnTrack was a group project. I wrote some of the HTML/CSS/JQuery on the front-end of the application and did all of the backend programming -- specifically, the PHP/MySQL.  I also did most of the wireframing of the interface at the beginning of the semester before our group formed.</p><br />

        <h4>Process</h4>
        Step-by-step description of creation of each project from beginning to end
        <ol>
          <li>Project Proposal</li>
          <li>Clickstream/Flowchart created</li>
          <li>Design Plan written</li>
          <li>Group formed</li>
          <li>Wireframes completed</li>
          <li>Basic application created</li>
          <li>Design work, mostly HTML/CSS/JQuery Mobile</li>
          <li>Back-end development finished</li>
          <li>Usability testing</li>
          <li>Project submitted</li>
        </ol><br />

        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>Even though this application offered a high number of features considering the time I had to build it, there are still several features I wanted to add. The primary one is social networking integration; I was hoping to allow users to sign up with their Facebook/Twitter accounts and then see which of their friends were using the application.  The ability for users to share accomplishments on Facebook or Twitter would have been useful as well.  I also would have liked greater account management features -- the ability for users to change their password or email, for example -- but ran out of time before that  could be implemented.  I also would have liked the ability for users to save their answers to the quizzes and see the scores, but again, time was an issue.</p>
        <p>I had originally planned to make some of these changes after the semester was over, since I really do believe this app would have been useful to any "fresh meat" roller derby player, but I unfortunately was injured in December and no longer am on the team. A substantial WFTDA rules overhaul also came out in January, so the application is now fairly outdated. As such, no further development took place after I submitted the project. I am, however, hoping to get back into derby after I finish grad school, so it is likely I would pick up this project once again in order to get myself back into a good training schedule.</p><br />
