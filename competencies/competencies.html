        <h3>Conducting needs assessment and evaluating learning systems</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="span6">
            <p>While most of the Educational Technology program is focused on the design and development of
              instructional systems, this competency is centered on the ability of students to thoroughly
              review a project's requirements and discover any problems or required improvements.  A needs assessment is a process that systematically determines a project's needs by finding performance "gaps" between its optimals and actuals, while evaluations are designed to assess whether a project is meeting its intended purpose. Results from both of these processes is criticial to both the design and the development of any learning system.</p>

        <h3>Designing learning environments, including systems for direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="span6">
            <p>Designing learning environments is a thorough, detailed process. For a learning
            environment to be truly effective, it is important for the designer to determine in detail the
            user's needs and how he or she will interact with the system. It is a process that must happen
            in carefully-planned stages; ideally, the designer will spend time determining the audience,
            their end goals, and their limitations before ever beginning work on wireframes or prototypes. The goal of this competency is to enable students to deliver a final product that is aesthetically pleasing and adheres to standards of usability and accessability.

        <h3>Developing learning systems applications or components of applications</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="span6">
            <p>The development of learning systems is a process that requires a wide variety of technical
              skills.  In addition to front-end development skills such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
              any web application developer also needs a thorough understanding of at least one server-side programming language, database design strategies, and application testing. This competency
              focuses on giving the student the skills needed to develop and deploy variety of applications,
              providing a solid foundation in programming fundamentals.</p>
