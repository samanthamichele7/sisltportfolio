            <h4>Artifact Description</h4>
            <p>The Graduate School SISLT Admissions Worksheet was a high-fidelity prototype created to assist applicants to MU's Information Sciences & Learning Technologies with keeping track of all the information required for the admissions process. The worksheet was tailored for each type of graduate applicant: the domestic student who has not attended MU before, the domestic student who has attended MU before, the current MU graduate student, and the international student. The worksheet details, step-by-step, what forms, paperwork, and other information is necessary depending on the category type the applicant fits into.  It is an accordion-style, mobile-optimized application that displays only one section at a time.</p><br />

            <h4>Artifact's Intended Purpose</h4>
            <p>As an admissions adviser, as well as a former SISLT applicant, I was well aware of the difficulties prospective students face when applying to MU's Graduate School. In addition to a long, detailed list of requirements -- documents, test scores, transcripts, etc. -- certain groups of applicants, such as international students, have additional requirements such as financial documents and degree certificates. On top of that, any documents that are turned in late or missing from the application file can disqualify a student from admissions consideration. The SISLT Admissions Worksheet was a performace support system designed to assist any type of applicant in navigating this complicated process by listing detailed requirements and tracking, step-by-step, which requirements have been addressed.

            The worksheet is designed to act as a sidekick, whih is defined by Allison Rossett and Lisa Schafer in their article "Job aids and performance support: the convergence of learning and work" as being "right there with us during performance. They coax, remind, direct, and inform about what to do at the time of need. The map in the glove box and the GPS are sidekicks that help as we travel. The step-by-step instructions on the sign within the voting booth help cast votes." Unlike some other types of performance support systems that might be used, this is something that would guide students step-by-step through the process of applying for graduate school (Rossett and Schafer, 10).</p>

        <h4>How does it demonstrate mastery of the competency?</h4>
        <p>When designing a performance support system, it is important to target the problem and make sure that the solution both simplifies and streamlines the objective. This application took a convoluted, confusing process -- applying to graduate school -- and assisted the student in gathering all materials required for the admission process. It requires little to no training, is accessible on mobile devices for students on the go, and incorporates elements such as behavioral language, chunked sections, and cognitive theories for multimedia to increase student understanding and retention. </p><br />
        
        <h4>Role in project</h4>
        <p>The SISLT Application Worksheet was group project. I handled all of the content (as I was most familiar with the admissions process due to my role in the Graduate School's admissions unit), interface design, all of the usability testing, and compiling the final report.</p><br />

        <h4>Reflection</h4>       
        <p>When I suggested this project to my assigned teammates, I was hoping to design a performance support system that addressed a problem I saw almost daily in my work as an admissions adviser. Even though SISLT has a fairly straightforward admissions process compared to many graduate departments at MU, it can still be a difficult and time-consuming process, especially for international students who face extra requirements imposed by the Graduate School itself. I enlisted the help of the SISLT student coordinator and the entire Graduate School admissions unit when designing the system, and I feel that the product is stronger as a result.</p>
        <p>Even though this system never progressed beyond a high-fidelity prototype -- it is not possible to actually register for the system or save data to any sort of database -- it would be fairly easy for an experienced developer to add server-side functionality to the prototype or integrate it into an existing content management system. At the time this system was developed, I was still learning back-end programming and was not necessarily capable of adding this functionality myself. If I were to continue work on this project, I would add these features so that this system could potentially be useful to students.</p><br />
